## Overview:
[Situational Intelligence Open Source Software (Siti OSS)](https://sitioss.info) (formerly known as CogniCity OSS) is an open source software for real-time disaster mapping and community-powered climate adaptation. 
Since 2017, [Yayasan Peta Bencana](https://petabencana.id) has stewarded the development of SITI OSS, in collaboration with [CivicDataLab](https://civicdatalab.in) and a growing network of contributors. Today, the software powers disaster information platforms serving **350M+ people** across Asia, trusted by over **900 organizations** and integrated into official government response systems.  

## ‚ú® What It Does

- Enables **community participation and coordination** in disaster response and risk reduction
- Powers peer-to-peer resource sharing for mutual aid during emergencies
- Delivers automated disaster notifications to keep communities informed
- Builds trust and transparency with two-way information sharing between citizens and government agencies
- Supports open collaboration through APIs and integration with official systems

## üõ† Features
- Multi-hazard disaster reporting (floods, fires, haze, typhoons, earthquakes, volcanoes, etc.) with customizable templates for localized hazards and adaptive scaling across countries
- Multi-channel input (Telegram, WhatsApp, Messenger, Viber, Twitter/X, web apps)
- Real-time geospatial mapping: high-volume data transformed into clear, actionable, interactive maps
- Multi-language support for diverse communities
- Peer-to-peer resource sharing for mutual aid: request and offer help directly during emergencies
- Automated alerts & notifications
- Government integration into disaster management workflows
- API integration: ingest official data streams
- Dedicated reporting streams for official information to enable two-way transparent information sharing
- Output APIs: interoperable endpoints for NGOs, researchers, developers
